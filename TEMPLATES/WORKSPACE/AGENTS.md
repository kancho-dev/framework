# Workspace Agent Instructions

Operate from the workspace root.

## Required Read Order

At the start of a main session, read:
1. `framework/FRAMEWORK.md`
2. `framework/SECURITY.md`
3. `framework/ENGINEERING.md`
4. `framework/ROLES/OVERSEER.md`
5. `ACTIVE-CONTEXT.md`
6. today's `memory/daily-brief-YYYY-MM-DD.md` if it exists

Load skills from `framework/SKILLS/` only when they are relevant to the current run.

When working inside a task directory, then read the task files in the order defined by `framework/FRAMEWORK.md`.

## Workspace Rules

1. Keep active workspace state in `ACTIVE-CONTEXT.md`.
2. Record durable fixes in `FIXES.md`.
3. Use `OPERATOR-NOTES.md` for Operator-maintained todos and ideas.
4. Keep durable project knowledge under `projects/[name]/library/`.
5. Keep task execution state under `projects/[name]/work/[task-slug]/`.
6. Treat `framework/` as the source of operating guidance for this workspace.
7. Treat `framework/` as read-only. Never edit files under `framework/` directly.

## Workspace-Specific Instructions

- [describe the main active project or workspace focus]
- [describe any local conventions or constraints]
